# This file defines the timer groups that can be selected.
# Each line contains the following fields that are separated by tabs:
# - Type: This can be any value (also string) that can be used in the logdef
#     to differentiate between groups. The function TimeKeeper::Core::is_timer_group_type()
#     can be used to match a Timer's Group's Type against a value or regex.
#     The Type can also be a list.
# - Color: This is the color that is used as background color for the group.
#     The format can be #rrggbb. This can be left empty for no coloring.
