# With:

# - Command: Command to execute when the menu entry is activated.
# Tips:
# * A DOS command can be run like this:
# start %COMSPEC% /c "dir & pause"     Execute multiple commands
# start %COMSPEC% /c "doit || pause"   Execute doit and pause if errors
# * If an entry is just '---', a separator is inserted
