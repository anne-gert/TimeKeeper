# Examples:
# - 's{(.{1,3}).*?\t(.*)}{$1...$2}': Take first 3 chars of prefix, then "..."
#     then the rest.
# - 's{([\w-]{1,5}+).{3,}?\t(.*)}{$1...$2}': Take 1st word of prefix with max

# External Tools to display in the main menu's Tools submenu.
# Each entry should be on a line like this:
# 	DisplayText :: Command
# With:
# - DisplayText: Text to display in the menu entry.
# - Command: Command to execute when the menu entry is activated.
# Tips:
# * A DOS command can be run with 'start %COMSPEC% /c ...'.
# * If an entry is just '---', a separator is inserted.
# * If an entry starts with a '#', it is ignored.
# Example:
# $ExtTools = '
#     Show directory and pause  :: start %COMSPEC% /c "dir & pause"
#     Backup and pause if error :: start %COMSPEC% /c "backup || pause"
#     ---
#     #This will not show
#     Show website              :: start http://example.com
